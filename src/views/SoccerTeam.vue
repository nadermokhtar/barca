    Futbol Club Barcelona , commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially
    known as Barça, is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Spain,
    that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. Founded in
    1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, German and English footballers led by
    Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism,
    hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other
    football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the
    fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the
    world's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover
    of €840.8 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça",
    written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Barcelona traditionally play
    in dark shades of blue and red stripes, leading to the nickname Blaugrana.
    Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 75 trophies: 26 La Liga, 31 Copa
    del Rey, thirteen Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa
    de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four
    competitions. In international club football, the club has won twenty
    European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record
    four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record
    three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. Barcelona was
    ranked first in the International Federation of Football History &
    Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and
    occupies the fourth position on the UEFA club rankings as of 2021. The club
    has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two
    teams are referred to as El Clásico. Barcelona is one of the most widely
    supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social
    media following in the world among sports teams. Barcelona players have won
    a record number of Ballon d'Or awards (twelve), with recipients including
    Johan Cruyff, as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year
    awards (seven), with winners including Ronaldo, Romário, Ronaldinho, and
    Rivaldo. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy
    (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best
    players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat
    for players from the same football academy. Additionally, players
    representing the club have won a record number (eight) of European Golden
    Shoe awards. Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera
    División that have never been relegated from the top division since its
    inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009,
    Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble
    consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also
    became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in
    a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and
    FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again and
    won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just
    four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the
    greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in
    2015, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to
    achieve the continental treble twice.
